**Eggs.SD-6**
==================

This sample project will generate on configuration an `sd-6.hpp` header file
at `${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}`, with the corresponding feature-test macro defined
for each feature detected as supported. When the macro is provided by the
implementation, the line containing the definition will be commented out.
